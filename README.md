# Weak Gaussian Blur

A sample program I made that apply a very Weak Gaussian Blur to an image.
Usage: ./cudaWeakBlur **level 1~9** ***path-to-image***

Dependencies: aside from the obvious cuda dependencies, there is a dependency on stb_image and stb_image_write.

Warning: In some combinations of images and specific levels there are some visual bugs, but I couldn't identify where they are on the code.
